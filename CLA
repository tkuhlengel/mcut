# CONTRIBUTOR AGREEMENTS

The MCUT project follows the Apache Software Foundation [model](https://apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html) when handling contributions. The project relies on two agreements to accept contributions of software code and documentation from individuals and corporations, respectively. 

These agreements help achieve the goal of providing a reliable and long-lived software product through collaborative, open-source software development. In all cases, contributors retain full rights to use their original contributions for any other purpose outside of MCUT, while providing CutDigital Enterprise Ltd (copyright owner) the right to distribute and build upon their work.

# CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENTS (CLA)

## Overview

The Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) is provided below. The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the MCUT project and thereby allow the copyright holder of the MCUT project to defend it should there be a legal dispute regarding the software. By contribution of ideas, code, or documentation to the MCUT project, a contributor acknowledges that they are bound by the terms laid out herein. The ICLA an individual acknowledges is not tied to any employer they may have.

The Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) is also provided below. The CCLA is available to cover contributing intellectual property via a corporation that may have been assigned as part of an employment agreement. Note that a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every developer to acknowledge their own ICLA as an individual, which covers both contributions the corporation owns, and those it does not own. The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so a person with authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation must acknowledge it.

CutDigital Enterprise will not publish your personal details as a contributor in any form except possibly via the revision history in source control.
