# LICENSING

MCUT is available under an [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) license as well as a commercial license. If you want to use MCUT under the free-of-charge Open Source license then you simply have to comply to its terms. Otherwise you will need to buy a commercial license. These options protect the project's commercial value and thus make it possible for the author(s) to guarantee long term support, maintenance and further development of the code for the benefit of the project and its users.

## Open Source License

The Open Source license is the GNU [Lesser General Public License, Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) (LGPL), which is allows developers to easily build on top of MCUT.

* Include a copy of the full license text and the original copyright notice
* Make available the source updates when distributing a derivative work based on the licensed sofware
* License any derivative works of the sofware under the same or later version of the LGPL or GPL as described above

In sum, the LGPL license gives you the right to use and copy the source code of MCUT freely. It is also possible to modify the MCUT code under the condition that the resulting modifications are released as source code under LGPL with any binary distribution of your software that uses these LGPL parts. 

## Commercial License

The commercial license option is for users that wish to use MCUT in their products for commercial purposes but do not wish to release their software under the LGPL. You can buy a commercial license from [CutDigital Enterprise](contact@cut-digital.com). The commercial offer is adapted based on company size (number of employees).
